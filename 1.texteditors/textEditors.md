# **Text Editors**

## What are text editors? 
A text editor refers to any form of computer program that enables users to create, change, edit, open and view plain text files. They come already installed on most operating systems but their dominant application has evolved from notetaking and creating documents to crafting complex code. 

We have commonly used text editors in the context of metagenomic processing for the purpose of drafting and saving scripts which will be used for analyses. 

## What are some common text editors?
The "best" text editor really comes down to personal preference.

[**BBEdit**](https://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/)

[**emacs**](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/)

[**Visual studio code**](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

Some such as BBEdit are nice as they are very straightforward and do not have many capabilities. 
Others, such as visual studio can be integrated with GitHub and R and have a number of in-app functionality but makes it more complex to learn.
