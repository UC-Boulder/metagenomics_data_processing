When writing code, people turn to text editors because they work with plain text. 
They are an essential tool and allow for writing, editing, and saving code.

Text editors can highlight code or include an indentation, but don't do much beyond those simple formatting functions.

The "best" text editor really comes down to personal preference.

Common text editors include: 
Sublime Text (https://www.sublimetext.com)
BBEdit (https://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/)
emacs (https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/)
